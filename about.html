        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>This is sivadeep kotha. I finished my under graduation in 2022. Currently I am  persuing my grauation in Oklahoma City University.I would like to become a Data Engineer and I have enough skills to be a developer.
            I really do plan to apply to a respectable university and pursue a degree in one of these disciplines. Being responsible and diligent, I put a lot of effort into my studies to get high scores.
            I enjoy interacting with new people and becoming friends with gregarious individuals. I don't apologise for who I am or how I've turned out.
